# Data Structures:
   ## 1. Definition: 
      Different tools to store and organize data on your computer.
   - **Example:** Arrays to store integers for upto 30 students' grades in a Calculus class.
   ## 2. Types:
   - Primitive: *(Pre-built into virtually all languages)*
      - Integers
      - Floats
      - Characters
      - Strings
      - Booleans
   - Non-Primitive: *(Developer defined)*
      - Linear: *(Data linearly sequenced in memory)*
         - Static: *(DS size is unchageable)*
            - Arrays
         - Dynamic: *(DS size is changeable)*
            - Linked Lists
            - Stacks
            - Queues
      - Non-Linear: *(Data non-linearly sequenced in memory)*
         - Trees
         - Graphs
      

# Algorithms:
 ## 1. Definition: 
      Steps to solve a task
   - **Example:** Graph Algorithm to find an efficient path on Google Maps.
 ## 2. Characteristics of Good Algorithms:
   - Correctness.
   - Efficiency.
 ## 3. Types of Algorithms:
   ### Brute Force
      1. Tests all possible outcomes.
      2. Finds satisfactory solution.
      3. **Example: Best path between two homes**
   ### Divide and Conquer
      1. Break the problem into smaller subproblems.
      2. Solve subproblems using recursion.
      3. Combine solutions to subproblems to get solution to original problem.
      4. **Example: Quicksort**
   ### Recursion: Algorithm that involves a self-calling method
      1. Perform the same operation multiple times with smaller and smaller inputs(Triggers recursive loop)
      2. Stop when base cases are reached(Ends recursive loop)
      3. Return outputs to obtain final answer
      4. **Example: Fibonacci Series**
   ### Dynamic Programming
      1. Use Memoization(Memory of past results).
      2. Find best answer.
      3. **Example: Optimization**
   ### Greedy
      1. Best Current Output--> During each phase of problem solving, we take the best current solution.
      2. By taking best local solution, we hope to arrive at the best global solution.
   ### Randomized
      1. Use random number generation for decision-making to solve a problem
      2. **Example: Average dice rolls to get 25**
