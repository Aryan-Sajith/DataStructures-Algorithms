# Data Structures:
   ## 1. Definition: 
      Different tools to store and organize data on your computer.
   - Example: Arrays to store integers for upto 30 students' grades in a Calculus class.
   ## 2. Types:
   - Primitive: *(Pre-built into virtually all languages)*
      - Integers
      - Floats
      - Characters
      - Strings
      - Booleans
   - Non-Primitive: *(Developer defined)*
      - Linear: *(Data linearly sequenced in memory)*
         - Static: *(DS size is unchageable)*
            - Arrays
         - Dynamic: *(DS size is changeable)*
            - Linked Lists
            - Stacks
            - Queues
      - Non-Linear: *(Data non-linearly sequenced in memory)*
         - Trees
         - Graphs
      

# Algorithms:
 ## 1. Definition: 
      Steps to solve a task
   - Example: Graph Algorithm to find an efficient path on Google Maps.
 ## 2. Characteristics of Good Algorithms:
   - Correctness.
   - Efficiency.
 ## 3. Types of Algorithms:
   - Brute Force
   - Divide and Conquer
   - Recursion(*Self-Calling*)
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Greedy
   - Randomized
